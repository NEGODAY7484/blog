Working with bibliography is an integral part of the scientific and research process. Correctly formatted bibliography not only enhances the quality of the scientific work, but also proves its scientific validity and authority.

But how do you work with bibliographic sources correctly? First of all, it is necessary to select them correctly. To do this, one needs to know how suitable the source is for solving a scientific problem, the quality and reliability of the information it contains.

One of the most important aspects of working with bibliography is its formatting. When formatting a bibliographic list, it is necessary to consider the requirements of the educational institution, scientific journal, etc. However, it is easy to remember the general principles of forming a bibliography.

The first thing to indicate is the author's name, followed by the title of the book, the year of its publication, and so on, depending on the type of source. In addition, do not forget that the bibliography should include all sources used in the preparation of the work, not just those directly quoted.

Finally, when working with bibliographic sources, do not forget about their storage. A good practice is to save all the sources found in a special folder on your computer, and also to keep them on records, sheets, or blanks.

As you can see, working with bibliography requires attention and accuracy. A correctly formatted bibliography will help indicate how well the scientific work is done and will become a guarantee of its authority.
