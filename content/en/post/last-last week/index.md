## Chronology of events

Last week, I enjoyed the beautiful weather and walked through Moscow's green zones. Despite the city being very lively and noisy, I found a number of cozy and quiet places where I could relax and unwind.

On Monday, I started my day with a walk in Timiryazevsky Park, which is located in the northern part of Moscow. I explored various pathways and alleys, enjoyed scenic views, and listened to bird songs. It was the perfect start to the week.

Next, I visited the Tsaritsyno Museum-Reserve to see the mansion of Empress Catherine II. I spent two hours there, admiring the beautiful gardens and architecture. Afterward, I went to GUM to have lunch.

On Tuesday, I went to Gorky Park, which is located in the city center. I strolled along its bustling alleys, enjoyed views of the Moscow River shoreline, and looked at the cathedrals of Moscow Kremlin in the distance.

The next place on my list was Zaryadye Park. I love this park for its contrasts - you'll find both modern and ancient Russian buildings here. I visited the Eastern Palace, the House Church, and other landmarks.

At the end of the week, I went for an evening walk in Sokolniki Park, to enjoy the fountains and colorful light show. It's worth noting that this is one of the most popular parks in Moscow, so I wasn't alone and enjoyed the fun actions of other people.

The week ended very well, and I was very satisfied and rested. I hope to find a few more amazing places in Moscow to explore and enjoy next week.
