Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code and manage projects. It allows developers to work on one project while keeping track of all changes and controlling them.

**One of Git's main functions is the ability to create branches, which allow for working on different versions of code. This allows developers to experiment, fix errors, and add new features without the risk of damaging the main branch.**

Additionally, Git provides the ability to merge branches. This means developers can combine their changes into one main branch, ensuring all changes are kept track of and controlled.

### Kickbacks

Git also allows for rolling back to previous versions of code. This can be useful if mistakes are made during development or if new features are not functioning properly.


Simply insert a Markdown `markmap` code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.

–í–µ—Ç–∫–∞ Git:

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - wowchemy
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms
  - wowchemy-plugins-reveal
```
</code>
</pre>
</div>

```markmap {height="200px"}
- –°–µ—Ä–≤–µ—Ä Github
  - –ö–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä ‚Ññ1(–°–®–ê)
  - –ö–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä ‚Ññ2(–†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è)
  - –ö–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä ‚Ññ3(–¢—É—Ä–∫–º–µ–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω)
  - –ö–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä ‚Ññ4(–ö–∏—Ç–∞–π)
```

Finally, Git provides the ability to collaborate. Developers can work on the same project, keeping track of all changes. This makes it easy to exchange code and collaborate on a remote server.

Overall, Git is a powerful tool for managing code versions. It allows developers to work on the same project, keeping track of all changes. If you are not using Git yet, we recommend starting to learn this version control system today!
