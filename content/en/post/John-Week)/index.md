## Chronology of events

Last week was very busy and productive for me. I devoted a lot of time to studying and, thanks to my diligence and active participation in classes, earned a good grade. Additionally, I was able to help many of my classmates by guiding and supporting them in the learning of various topics, which was very rewarding for me.

Meeting new people was also a big accomplishment for me. I met interesting and intelligent individuals who will definitely be important for my professional development. We communicated in classes and even exchanged experiences in learning, which contributed to further expansion of my knowledge.

I also found time to help one of my acquaintances with their homework and simply support friends in difficult situations. I realized that helping and supporting people around us is one of the main conditions for success in life.

Overall, last week was very instructive and inspiring for me. I learned a lot of new things, found new friends, and was able to demonstrate my best qualities, as well as provide assistance to those who needed it.
