## Chronology of events

The past week was very intense for me. I hardly left my house because I was busy with studying and projects. I spent all my free time on my computer, specifically on my laptop.

My main task was to write programs for various Python projects. I learned about different libraries, efficient algorithms, and problem-solving methods. It was very interesting and informative because I gained new knowledge and skills that will be useful to me in the future.

In addition, I learned how to create projects using Arduino. This microcontroller allows you to implement various ideas - from simple LED beacons to complex devices with automatic control systems. I assembled prototypes and programmed different modules.

I also studied neural networks - one of the most promising areas of programming that allows you to create artificial intelligence systems. I learned a lot about how multilayer neural networks work and how they can be used to solve complex problems.

Every day I learned something new and practiced my skills. Although I didn't go outside, I still felt that the past week was very productive and interesting. I am confident that the knowledge I gained will be useful to me in the future and help me reach new heights in programming.
