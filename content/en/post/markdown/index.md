## Markdown markup language

Markdown is a simple text markup language used for formatting and styling text without the need to learn complex programming languages and commands. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 for use in blogs, websites, and email to facilitate easy text writing and formatting.

The main idea behind Markdown is that each markup element has its own meaning, making it easy to quickly and easily create bold text, headings, lists, tables, and links. The syntax of Markdown is intuitive and simple to learn. Here are some examples:

Markdown markup easily converts to HTML, allowing it to be used with any documents, including web pages, presentations, e-books, and developer documentation. Many websites, including GitHub, use Markdown to format repository descriptions, README files, and other documents.

Markdown is an open standard and available for use in any applications and content management systems. There are many tools and editors, including Atom, VS Code, MarkdownPad, and Typora, that provide the ability to use Markdown for writing and formatting text.

Overall, Markdown provides a convenient and fast way to format and style text without needing to know complex programming languages. It allows users to focus on the content of the text, rather than on formatting.
